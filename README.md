# **Beginner Friendly Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Resources**

-----

- Book:
  
  - [A Practical Introduction to Python Programming - Heinold](https://www.brianheinold.net/python/A_Practical_Introduction_to_Python_Programming_Heinold.pdf)

- Courses:

  - Udemy Python for Data Science and Machine Learning course.
    - [Official Udemy course work](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)  
      Use the paid course work on udemy for guaranteed certification.
    - [Free course materials download on FreeCourseSite](https://freecoursesite.com/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp-13/)  
      This is good to have the couorse materials locally on your machine for reference at any time throughout your learning process, note however that you'll not get the certification for the course using this method.  
      A good way to make use of this method is to document your learning process by completing projects in the course and redoing every module personally(duplicate the jupyter notebooks and code along with the given instructions) and push your code to github. You may also fork this [repo](https://github.com/lyraxvincent/Data-Science-Machine-Learning-Portfolio) that follows this method on this same course!
    
  - Python courses in Machine Learning on [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)  
    These are also very beginner friendly and are well consolidated.


- Other:

  -[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)  
   There are vast learning materials and problem solutions on kaggle; many great resources just scrolling.
